# Mortgage-Calculator

This is a Mortgage Calculator used to compare payoff terms and rates in order to find out what the best term/rate deal to pay off your loan (Mortgage, car, etc.) is for you.

You must compare your given term/rate with at least one custom term/rate (else enter in the same term/rate information as the original), and may compare up to 3 term/rate combinations. Add a name to your loan calculation (ex: "Ocean Drive Home" or "New Car"), and save your calculated comparisons to come back to at another time.

Features include: 
<ul><li>calculating monthly payments </li>
  <li>calculating total interest paid</li>
  <li>calculating total money saved from custom term/rate over the original term/rate</li>
  <li>a chart showing you visually the amount of interest paid on top of the original loan.</li>
</ul>
